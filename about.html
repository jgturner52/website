I am a cradle-to-halfway-to-the-grave Presbyterian (straddling mainline and evangelical Protestantism) and belong to
Burke Presbyterian Church. I came of age in evangelical parachurch organizations, namely Young Life and InterVarsity
Christian Fellowship, and one of the things that drew me to the study of U.S. History was a desire to understand the
institutions and personalities that had shaped my own religious culture. My dissertation-turned-first book, Bill
Bright and Campus Crusade for Christ: The Renewal of Evangelicalism in Postwar America, won Christianity Today’s
2009 prize for best History / Biography.


LDS Lane, Joseph Smith Birthplace, 2010
Enough navel-gazing! After my first book, I wanted to occupy terrain less familiar to me. I had considered writing a
study of the Latter-day Saints and conservative politics since 1945, but as I began examining the history of
Mormonism, I found myself pulled toward the earlier time period. The result was Brigham Young: Pioneer Prophet. I
had an enormous amount of fun writing this book. My portrait of Young emphasizes his early religious experiences
(such as speaking in tongues), the effect of Joseph Smith’s murder on Young’s personality and approach to
leadership, Young’s outsized family, and his thirty-year battle with the U.S. government for control of the Utah
Territory.

After spending several years researching the life and times of Brigham Young, I wanted to focus more intently on
Mormonism’s place within the broader tapestry of Christianity. Whether reading Mormon scriptures or entering
Latter-day Saint chapels or visitors’ centers, one can hardly ignore the centrality of Jesus Christ. At the same
time, many Protestants and Catholics consider the LDS Church something other than Christian, and many scholars
describe Mormonism as a “new religion.” I explore the many ways that Latter-day Saints have described and
experienced the Christian savior in The Mormon Jesus.

Most recently, I have written a history of Plymouth Colony, appearing in conjunction with the 400th anniversary of
the Mayflower crossing. In They Knew They Were Pilgrims, a group of English settlers intending to plant the pure
church of Christ in North America stumbles into the hard realities of starvation, disease, native alliances and
antagonisms, trans-Atlantic trade, and British politics. I explain what the Pilgrims understood by “liberty” and how
other peoples in Plymouth Colony contested that meaning and expanded its bounds.
